# Introduction {-}

Software can't be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in
spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn't produced in factories on an
assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software
developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an
essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. My goal
for this book is to help you get started with Unix by writing the book I would
have wanted when I was first learning Unix. If you have any additions,
corrections, or comments for this book please open an issue or send a pull
request to: https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench. If you're unsure
what a pull request is you'll find out in this book!
