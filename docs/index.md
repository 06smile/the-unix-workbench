# Introduction {-}

This book is intended for folks who are new to programming and new to Unix-like
operating systems like macOS and Linux distributions like Ubuntu. Command line 
interfaces can seem alien at first, so this book
attempts to draw parallels between using the command line and actions that you
would normally take while using your computer's graphical interface.
To get the most out of using Unix tools, this book will show you how to write
little pieces of software. 

Software can't be mined out of the ground, nor can software seeds be planted in
spring to harvest by autumn. Software isn't produced in factories on an
assembly line. Software is a hand-made, often bespoke good. If a software
developer is an artisan, then Unix is their workbench. Unix provides an
essential and simple set of tools in a distraction-free environment. Even if
you're not a software developer learning Unix can open you up to new methods
of thinking and novel ways to scale your ideas. My goal
for this book is to help you get started with Unix by writing the book I would
have wanted when I was first learning Unix. If you have any additions,
corrections, or comments for this book please open an issue or send a pull
request to: https://github.com/seankross/the-unix-workbench. If you're unsure
what a pull request is you'll find out in this book!
