# Getting Unix

## Mac & Ubuntu Users

If you're using a Mac or you're using the Ubuntu operating system find a
program called **Terminal** and open it. You can skip the next section about
Windows.

## Windows

If you're using Windows you should
download a program called [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads),
then open up Git Bash. Git Bash is not able to access all of the features of
Unix so some of the topics discussed in this book may not work with Git Bash.
For a full Unix experience you should download 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and then set up the latest version of
Ubuntu with VirtualBox. Instructions for doing this tend to change slightly
over time, so I suggest using Google to search for "how to install ubunutu on
windows with virtualbox" and then you can follow the instructions that you find.
